# Recreating Space Invaders

## Project Overview
Since I was young, I have a great memory playing Space Invaders in the arcade in Seoul, Korea. I would want to recreate this game into my own project
## Background Knowledge & Purpose
I have done some research in Cinder, and I will use WMFVideo, poScene, and proSpritesheet
## Estimated Timeline
Week 1: Linking to the cinder libraries
Week 2: Game Engine
Week 3: Game Interface

## Extra "Stretch goals"
I would create multiple modes of the game if I finish the project earlier than intended.
